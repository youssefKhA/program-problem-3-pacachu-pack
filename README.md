## Program Problem 3 :  Three_Digit_Ascend_Descend_Selection
 
Assume that a completely trustworthy and perfect user comes along and will enter a 3 digit number into your program
as you ask for it. Create a new empty project and make sure you have a header that includes both of your names on the project. 

# 1.	Ask for the completely trustworthy and perfect user to enter a 3 digit number into your program.

# 2.	Store that number into a variable.

# 3.	Take that variable and separate each of the three digits into separate variables. 

# 4.	Using those and selection of some nature. Print out whether the Number is Ascending or Descending based on the fact that each number is less than or greater than the previous number. 

# 5.	Once this is done, go back over your code, and make sure you have comments so that your code is clearly understood by every member of the class.
